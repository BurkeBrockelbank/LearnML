Hello,

  Welcome to the very first portion of my Monkey Simulator. Although this project will eventually be expanded to include interactions with monkeys and simulate tribal behavior and cooperation, the first job is to get monkeys to survive in a test tube environment. What I mean is, the monkey needs to learn that it needs food to survive.

  This is an evolution simulator. Monkeys are born in with no knowledge in a room with a banana, and eventually they should evolve to seek out and eat the banana.

  1) Begin with creating an empty, square room.
  2) Put a monkey in the room.
  3) Have to design the monkey's vision (can't see around walls or other barriers).
  4) Create a neural net "brain" for the monkey to interpret its vision and translate that into a move order.
  5) Create an ensemble of of monkeys in the same room each with their own tweaks on the brain.
  6) Add in hunger so they die if they don't eat.
  7) Every turn, breed the monkeys with survivors to keep the numbers up.
  8) Evolve a monkey that heads to food.
